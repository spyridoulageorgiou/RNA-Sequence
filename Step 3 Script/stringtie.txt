#Quality check: How many transcripts and genes are composed of just a single exon? (We
usually consider “single exon” structures to have lower confidence than multi-exon ones).
Deliverable: One meta-assembly GTF format file.

#1. Get only lines with exons in 3rd column
#2. print second column using ; delimiter
#3. Get number of how many exons we have for each transcript -> this information is located on the first column but is space separated
#4. Print first column based on space separation
#5. Get all the lines that have exactly one count (-w)
#6. Get number of lines

###Download BAM Files

scp sgeorgiou@binfservms01.unibe.ch:/data/courses/rnaseq_course/lncRNAs/Project2/users/SGeorgiou/Data/bam_files_reverse/*.bam /home/Spyridoula/Desktop

there is a chance that there are novel exons let's say 10.000, but this is just noise.
put merged gtf file in igv
gtf + genome fasta + gff read for kalisto
sleuth(?)
bigwig to load all the ban files


download bam file with secure copy
the important thing to find is how many of the novel transcipt are single exons
check the blue and the red ribbons in igv. shashimi plot shows the transcript and the slpice junctions
callisto: quantifies gene expression
kallisto --> GTF + FASTA of the genome -(we use gff read which extracts the transcriptome sequence)-> Quantify
kallisto pseudoalligns the reads to the transcriptome
or htseq count
fastq --> GTF + FASTA of the genome -(we use gff read which extracts the transcriptome sequence)-> Kallisto
